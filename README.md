The Employee Management System is designed to simplify and automate various employee-related tasks, such as tracking attendance, managing leave requests, and maintaining employee records. The system provides a user-friendly interface for administrators and employees to access and interact with the platform efficiently.

## Features

- **Employee Details:** Store employee information in a database table and provide REST API endpoints for data entry and retrieval. The employee details include attributes such as employee ID, name, email, contact number, date of joining, and years of experience.
- **Department Details:** Maintain department information in a separate database table and expose REST API endpoints for CRUD operations on department data. The department details include attributes such as department ID, name, location, and manager ID.
- **Employee-Department Assignment:** Provide functionality to assign an employee to a department. Each employee can be assigned to only one department at a time. Implement REST API endpoints to facilitate this assignment process.
- **Employee Promotion:** Include an option to promote eligible employees to manager positions. To be considered for a manager role, an employee must have a minimum of 5 years of experience. Use the employee's date of joining to validate this criteria. Implement REST API endpoints to handle the promotion functionality.
